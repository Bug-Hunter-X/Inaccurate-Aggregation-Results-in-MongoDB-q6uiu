# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using MongoDB aggregation pipelines: inaccurate results due to issues in the pipeline stages. The original code contains a flaw in either the matching or grouping logic, leading to incorrect counts.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous aggregation pipeline. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version.  The issue involved an incorrect field used in grouping or matching, leading to an unintended data aggregation and producing incorrect results.  The solution pinpoints the exact error and presents a corrected pipeline to produce the expected results.
